# SAT based sudoku solver

This is a repository showcasing how to use a SAT solver (specifically
MiniSat) to solve Sudoku. It was made as a part of
[this blog post about SAT solvers](https://codingnest.com/modern-sat-solvers-fast-neat-underused-part-1-of-n/).

## Other solvers
As a part for my talk (and future post in the serious about SAT solvers),
I've asked some friends to also write a simple sudoku solver in C++. This
is their list.

* Aleš Hrabalík wrote a fairly performant solver that can be found [on his github](https://github.com/hrabalik/sudoku)
